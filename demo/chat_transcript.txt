User: Hi, I’m having surgery next week at 8 am, when should I stop eating and drinking before the procedure?
Bot: Based on the guidelines provided, it’s generally recommended that you don’t eat after midnight. However, you can continue to drink clear fluids such as water, pulp-free juice (like apple or cranberry), sports drinks, black tea, or coffee until 3 hours before your surgery time.

For your specific situation, since your surgery is at 8 am, you should stop eating after midnight and stop drinking clear fluids by 5:00 am the next day. This will ensure that you’re fasting for the recommended amount of time to minimize the risk of aspiration during anesthesia.

Remember to take any prescribed medications with sips of water as instructed by your doctor or nurse practitioner.

This is not medical advice. Always follow your surgical team’s instructions.
